# Create-a-CPI-Project
Create a CPI with a basket tailored explicitly to college student consumer products and compare it to the general inflation CPI basket, using Bureau of Labor and Statistics (API) data

#### Basket Goods
+ `Transportation`
+ `Cereal`
+  `Gas`
+  `Recreation`
+  `Alcoholic beverages`
+  `Rent`
+  `Electricity`
+  `Apparel`

#### Locations
+ `North East`
+ `Midwest`
+ `South`

#### Results
While this CPI isn't as resistant to fluctuations (less robust) as the much larger general CPI, as expected because it is much smaller and, therefore, less diverse, it still captures the overall trend of the general inflation.  It appears that standard consumer products integral to college students' lives are more sensitive to inflation, such as gas, recreation, and rent (especially on college campuses).  This could also contribute to the volatility of their CPI compared to the general.
